<p>From an article in <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/161266/qanon-classism-marjorie-taylor-greene" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">The New Republic</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The University of Minnesota’s Joanne Miller and Christina Farhart and Colorado State University’s Kyle Saunders conducted a survey examining support for conspiracy theories, including birtherism and 9/11 trutherism. In a result unsurprising to those who follow this research, they found that higher levels of political knowledge actually deepened the likelihood that conservatives with low trust in people and major institutions would endorse right-wing conspiracy theories. In a section reviewing previous research on the subject, the authors explained that political sophisticates “have the ability to make connections between abstract principles and more concrete attitudes and are therefore more fully able to notice the implications of specific attitudes for their worldviews.” “Because politically knowledgeable people care more about politics and hold stronger political attitudes,” they added, “they are especially likely to want to protect those attitudes.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The researchers conclude that &ldquo;people will believe what they want to believe in spite of available data and evidence.&rdquo;</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Tweet to Toot</title><link>https://leo.fm/2021/01/tweet2toot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://leo.fm/2021/01/tweet2toot/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>I admit the timing is confusing.

Here are some preliminary notes.</p>
<p>This MBP 13&quot; is identical to the previous Intel 13&quot; outwardly, but inside, it&rsquo;s very different. I maxed it out with 16GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD and it&rsquo;s noticeably snappier. No the fan is never audible, and even when rendering a large 4K Motion file it only gets a little warm. And battery life is the best of any system I&rsquo;ve ever used. It depends a lot on what I&rsquo;m doing but it&rsquo;s always at least 9 hours and usually around 15.</p>
<p>All that&rsquo;s great but you have to weigh it against the issues of software compatibility. Over time Apple Silicon&rsquo;s advantages over Intel will increase, while software issues will gradually disappear. But <em>today</em> the issue of incompatible software could be significant<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, especially at the edges.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://isapplesiliconready.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Is Apple Silicon Ready website</a> has a decent list of some big names that are (and aren&rsquo;t yet) native. But under the surface lurk many thousands of programs that just don&rsquo;t run. All Apple programs run natively. Many popular Mac programs run natively. Many CLI and dev tools don&rsquo;t run at all.</p>
<p>Yes it&rsquo;s a cool architecture, yes it&rsquo;s really fast, but unless you feel like your machine is slow (I didn&rsquo;t feel that way with any Macs in the past couple of years), and you&rsquo;re sure the programs you need will work, it might be worth waiting until the Mac dev community gets with it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep track of the issues I&rsquo;m encountering in the following table.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Note: I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://www.macports.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Macports</a> as my package manager.</p>

<p>I suppose for some of the command-line utilities it might be possible to compile from source using gcc but many libraries aren&rsquo;t ported yet (notably gnutls), others like OpenJDK and Electron have been ported but we&rsquo;re still waiting for their dependent projects to update. Many apps have ARM versions; so maybe it&rsquo;s a Big Sur issue?</p>
<p>Update: I built Racket CS from source (using the latest version from Github). It&rsquo;s now Apple native and man is it FAST! Faster even than Racket BC on my iMac Pro with 64GB of RAM.</p>
<p>Honestly, two months in, I don&rsquo;t even want to use any other computer. The M1 MacBook is the best laptop I&rsquo;ve ever owned. I&rsquo;m very excited to see what Apple does in 2021. I&rsquo;ll probably replace all our Macs. Intel just doesn&rsquo;t cut it any more.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/frequent-rapid-testing-could-turn-national-covid-19-tide-within-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">study</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“These rapid tests are contagiousness tests,” said senior co-author Dr. Michael Mina, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “They are extremely effective in detecting COVID-19 when people are contagious.”</p>
<p>They are also affordable, he added. The rapid tests can cost as little as $1 each and return results in 15 minutes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Best of all, &ldquo;testing half the population weekly with inexpensive, rapid-turnaround COVID-19 tests would drive the virus toward elimination within weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is something we could do today to end the pandemic by Christmas. The FDA has already approved the tests.</p>

This is how I responded.</p>
<p>I’ll tell you what I do, but this is only what works for me. I don’t have any talent. I can&rsquo;t tell jokes. I can’t juggle. I&rsquo;m not sexy. So all I can do is try to be myself, be likable, and serve my audience. I’m always trying to get to the love that’s at the core of all human interactions. For me, connecting with the audience is to love and honor who they are. And connecting with the audience is my job. It’s what I strive to do every time I’m on the air.</p>
<p>I do very little prep these days - I should definitely do more but I’m lazy. Remember I’ve been on the radio for 43 years, and doing interviews since 1987, so everything I do is totally internalized and mostly unconscious. There’s no way I could pass it on to you, and you wouldn’t want me to if I could, since the essence of being good on the air is to be totally yourself. And, bad news, you can’t <em>pursue</em> being centered and authentic on the air. You can only relax into it. And that just takes practice. It took me 15 years before I was any good.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In interviews, I am naturally curious. That helps. Always pay attention like a hawk to what people are saying. They’ll tell you what they want to talk about. Make it a conversation, not a series of questions. I will sometimes think of a question or two ahead of time, just so I have something to fall back on, but generally, if you are really engaged in the conversation, the next question will come easily. Never be thinking of what you’re going to ask next; you’ll miss the cues your guest is giving you. The essence of great interviewing is to be a great listener. Engage in the conversation and let your natural curiosity direct you. Be very careful about trying to show what you know. I hear a lot of interviewers trying to be smart. It’s better to be dumb. That’s how you learn.</p>
<p>I think it is worth trying to be as honest and genuine as you can be at all times. People can sniff inauthenticity. There’s plenty of it on the airwaves, but I believe people want to see you as you are. That’s scary because there’s always the risk people won’t like you, but it’s better to be yourself than to try to appeal to people by putting on a false persona. If they don’t like you, so be it.</p>
<p>Be open, be kind, and always aim toward honesty. It’s hard enough in real life, and it’s even harder on-the-air because you can&rsquo;t see your audience. It’s easy to fall into the trap of being automatic. Always strive to be present and always ask yourself, “am I telling the truth?”</p>
<p>Studying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisational_theatre" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">improv</a> was useful. In improv the rule is always to respond to every prompt with &ldquo;yes, and&rdquo; - never block, never say no. In improv you learn to listen. You also learn how to center and relax even while your energy is soaring. When the mic comes on you&rsquo;re going to feel a rush of energy. Use it, don&rsquo;t let it run you. You want to get into a heightened state of awareness without becoming amped up. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</a> calls it flow. You&rsquo;re always working to get into the flow state. Also, learn how to pronounce long last names.</p>
<p>This is all very meta advice. I don’t do “talent coaching.” Sometimes coaching is as simple as telling someone to say “you know” less, but I don’t like to operate at that level. You should do that yourself. Watch video and look for repetitive verbal crutches and tics. Practice reading until you can be fluent, even the first time you see something. I make little notes to myself about goals, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t interrupt,&rdquo; &ldquo;slow down,&rdquo; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t curse,&rdquo; etc. and then store them in the back of my mind. Practice one thing at a time. It’s good to work on technique, but you don’t want to become self-conscious.</p>
<p>It’s like learning to be a pro-basketball player. You can work on your skills, and I guess you have to, but nothing is going to sing until you can stop being self-conscious enough to flow. If you’re “working at it” on-the-air it shows. Never let them see you sweat. You don’t want to make your audience worry about you. You want them to feel like you’re supremely confident and in control. But if you’re not, and stuff is falling apart, don’t hide it, be honest. Don’t freak out, enjoy yourself. That’s another way to be in control: own what’s going on. Your audience always knows exactly what’s going on. Don’t cover up, own up.</p>
<p>Sometimes it all goes to hell. It happens to all of us. Don’t sweat it. Tomorrow is another show. Keep striving to connect with your audience, to be human, to be honest, to be vulnerable. Strip away the protective shell we all wear and be present. The best on-air talent is totally real.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to study others and notice what works. I love to study veteran performers. I am always impressed with how calm and in command they are. They never strive to entertain, they just do. Think of the person you like best on the air. What makes them interesting? What makes you <em>like</em> them? Find that in yourself. Don’t be them, of course, be you, but it&rsquo;s normal to start out by imitating your heroes and develop your own style later. I was heavily influenced by David Letterman, and copied his mannerisms for a long time. Before that it was Don Imus. I liked them because they never seemed to be trying to please their audiences. They had a &ldquo;take it or leave it&rdquo; attitude. My career didn&rsquo;t take off until I stopped trying so hard. You don&rsquo;t want to be smarmy or ingratiating. Be cool.</p>
<p>Always remember you are there to serve your audience. That’s where the humility comes from. They aren&rsquo;t here to listen to you; you are there to serve them. To keep them company. To inform. To entertain. To make their lives better. Even just to give them a little break from the day-to-day. You are performing a great service. Be grateful for the opportunity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s everything I know about being on-the-air. Now forget what I said and be yourself. Getting to perform for others is a great privilege. Enjoy it.</p>

<p>Ira Glass from <em>This American Life</em> has the definitive quote: &ldquo;All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.” <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Life is short, so it’s worth eliminating the time wasters. For one, defending yourself online.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your instinct when attacked is to defend yourself.  But like a lot of instincts, this one wasn&rsquo;t designed for the world we now live in.  Counterintuitive as it feels, it&rsquo;s better most of the time not to defend yourself.  Otherwise these people are literally taking your life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that’s just one of many powerful ideas in this essay. Please take 10 of your precious remaining minutes  to read it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One heuristic for distinguishing stuff that matters is to ask yourself whether you&rsquo;ll care about it in the future.  Fake stuff that matters usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter.  That&rsquo;s how it tricks you.  The area under the curve is small, but its shape jabs into your consciousness like a pin.</p>

End Daylight Saving Time!</p>
<p>The august <a href="https://aasm.org/american-academy-of-sleep-medicine-calls-for-elimination-of-daylight-saving-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Academy of Sleep Medicine</a> has finally proclaimed the truth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The AASM supports a switch to permanent standard time, explaining in the statement that standard time more closely aligns with the daily rhythms of the body’s internal clock. The position statement also cites  evidence of <strong>increased risks of motor vehicle accidents, cardiovascular  events, and mood disturbances following the annual “spring forward” to  daylight saving time</strong>.</p>
<p>“Permanent, year-round standard time is the best choice to most closely match our circadian sleep-wake cycle,” said lead author Dr. M. Adeel Rishi, a pulmonology, sleep medicine and critical care specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and vice chair of the AASM Public Safety Committee. “Daylight saving time results in more darkness in the morning and more light in the evening, disrupting the body’s natural rhythm.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The AASM position statement on daylight saving time has been endorsed by the following organizations:</p>

<li>American Academy of Cardiovascular Sleep Medicine</li>
<li>American Academy of Dental Sleep Medicine</li>
<li>American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST)</li>

It&rsquo;s fun to hear a &ldquo;new&rdquo; album from the artist at his peak.</p>

<p><em>Homegrown</em> was recorded in 1974 and 1975 at various venues. Young planned to release it with <em>Tonight&rsquo;s The Night</em>, but never did, perhaps because most of the record was an angry elegy for his broken relationship with actor Carrie Snodgress. But in this century, with hit breakup albums from the likes of Taylor Swift and Beyoncé (well, near breakup), Neil has finally set his anger free.</p>
<p>I always wonder what it would be like to hear a new Beatles song. Would I love it as much as I love the songs I&rsquo;ve been hearing my whole life? Here&rsquo;s my answer. Hearing these new, old, Neil Young songs for the first time is like meeting someone new and feeling like you&rsquo;ve known them forever. &ldquo;Try&rdquo; followed by &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; and the classic &ldquo;Love is a Rose&rdquo; compose three perfect Neil Young songs in a row.</p>
<p>Featuring performances by Robbie Robertson, Levon Helm, and Emmylou Harris, <em>Homegrown</em> is a very welcome addition to my quarantine playlist.</p>

<p>Consider it a work in progress — like me. I don’t expect to kick the bucket any time soon, but these are songs that mean a lot to me and would make for a fitting final farewell.</p>

<p>I listen to it from time to time and it makes me feel good. Maybe it will help my loved ones say goodbye.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
